Little training python scripts
A few little training python scripts made as tasks from different courses and books and which seed to me intresting.

For start these scripts you should have python interpreter on your computer and use terminal or IDE.

Short discriptions and instruction manuals for each scripts:

- most_repited_word_in_text:
a script which reads text from a file and displays the most frequent word in this text and how many times it met. 
If there are several such words, print the first lexicographically. Words written in different registers count
the same.
