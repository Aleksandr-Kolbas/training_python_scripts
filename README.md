Little training python scripts
A few little training python scripts made as tasks from different courses and books and which seemed to me intresting.

For start these scripts you should have python3 interpreter on your computer and use terminal (python3 name.py) or IDE (open file.py and run).

Short discriptions and instruction manuals for each scripts:

- api_number.py:
a script which shows an interesting math fact (if any) about the requested number from the website http://numbersapi.com/ (to know more visit it!) through its API.

- fib.py:
a script which calculates fibonacci numbers. To remind: the Fibonacci numbers, form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

- iter_primes.py:
a script which computes and generate prime numbers in a given interval in ascending order, starting with 2. To remind: a prime number is a whole number greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and itself.

- backup.py:
a script which makes a backup in zip-archive of selected directories in other created or selected directories. You can choose several directories to back-up and specify them in a list. You also specify/create a main backup directory, where backup must be stored. The current date will be the name of the subdirectory in the main backup directory. While backup creating you can input comment for it (optional). The name of the backup file itself will be the current time with the coment. So, for instance, if you make several backups in one day, names of backup files will be different (current time), but store in the same subdirectory with name the current date. Name of subdirectory will change on the other day. I think it's usefull and understandable.

- most_repited_word_in_text.py:
a script which reads text from a file and shows the most frequent word in this text and how many times it met. 
If there are several such words, print the first lexicographically. Words written in different registers count
the same.
